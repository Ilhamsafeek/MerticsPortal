		 <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
        
          <p>In Agile Methodology, the entire project is divided into
several sprints or iterations of equal time duration. These
iterations are assigned to the cross-functional teams.
The working product is delivered after each iteration
and is open for the client’s feedback. This methodology
provides flexibility to change the priority of the features
to be implemented</p>

		 <h2>Waterfall Methodology</h2>
        
          <p>Waterfall Methodology is the conventional methodology of software development in which a linear and sequential
process is used to deliver the project. The next phase can be initiated only if the previous phase is completed, in
order to avoid overlapping. It involves meticulous record keeping and the client’s feedback can be incorporated only
when the project is completed. This methodology works well for the projects where the scope is fixed and
requirements are clearly understood.</p>
